#+Title: Kaggle Amazon Employee Access Challenge Source Code
#+Author: John Cardente

* Overview

This repository contains R source code for the model I developed for
the Kaggle [[http://www.kaggle.com/c/amazon-employee-access-challenge][Amazon Employee Access Challenge]]. The model worked well 
with respect to accuracy but didn't achieve a good [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic][area under ROC curve]] 
score.

* Model

I treated the challenge as a market basket analysis problem. Each observation
is treated as a basket containing the specific role attributes and resource. 
I then used traditional [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rules][association rule]] metrics, specifically confidence, to
determine the likelihood that each test case would result in an access grant.
